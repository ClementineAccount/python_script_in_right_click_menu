# python_script_in_right_click_menu
A script to add a python script to the right-click (context Menu) on windows.
This was forked from https://github.com/seddie95/python_script_in_right_click_menu without any changes (so far). I decided to fork it because it seems useful, and I could see myself improving it by accomdating... it being ran itself as a right-click context menu shortcut...

## Intsruction 
Before running this script open your terminal or IDE in administrator mode to allow for the editing of registry information.

The winreg module is required to access the contents of the windows registry <br>
pip install winregistry

Modify script to insert your own python script to be shown in the context menu
